# Smart car
Final project from Mecahnics: Calculating possible actions of a smart car, in case of yellow light.

## Installation

To install simply type
```
./setup.py
```
in your terminal. Note that you must have **pyqt-4** prior running this script (I
couldn't add it as a dependency since I couldn't find it in python package
repositories. Any solution to this problem will be highly appreciated).

##Usage

After installation simply type
```
python3 smart_car
```
A window will pop up, where you shall input the information needed. After that
press `Submit` button and the graph will be ploted.
